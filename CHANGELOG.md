# Changelog

All notable changes to Tine are documented here. Tine is a fast, local-first
outliner that reads and writes a real Logseq Markdown (and now Org) graph.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); versions use
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Software-rendering warning.** If Tine detects it's painting on the CPU
  (GPU acceleration unavailable — most often an AppImage whose bundled graphics
  libraries don't match your system), it shows a banner explaining why scrolling
  may feel slow and how to get the fast path back. Speed is the whole point; a
  silent fallback shouldn't read as "Tine is slow."
- **Smooth scrolling (experimental, opt-in).** Settings → Appearance →
  *Smooth scrolling* animates the journal feed to smooth out WebKitGTK's stepped
  mouse-wheel jumps. Off by default; a feel experiment, easy to switch back off.

### Changed

- **`/priority` now leaves a trailing space** so the next word or `/command`
  flows without manually adding one. The convenience space is never saved
  (trailing whitespace is trimmed, matching Logseq).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-26

The big one: **Tine now opens, renders, and edits Org-mode graphs**, gets real
**in-block lists & checklists**, learns to **embed video/audio and manage media**,
and handles **custom journal date formats** — on top of a round of data-safety and
performance hardening. Everything still round-trips your plain files; Tine never
takes over your graph.

### Added

- **Org-mode support.** Open, render, and edit `.org` pages and journals:
  headlines as blocks; org inline syntax (`*bold*`, `/italic/`, `_underline_`,
  `~code~`, `[[target][desc]]`); TODO markers; `#+BEGIN_SRC`/`QUOTE` blocks; org
  tables; `#+` page directives; inline timestamps; and admonitions/callouts.
  Mixed `.md` + `.org` graphs work, and the **File format** setting
  (`:preferred-format`) chooses what new pages/journals are created in. An `.org`
  file is only ever rewritten when Tine can reproduce it **byte-for-byte** —
  anything it can't round-trip loads **read-only**, so it can never corrupt an
  org graph.
- **In-block Markdown lists & checklists.** OG-faithful `-`/`*`/`+` bullets and
  `1.` numbered lists *inside* a block, plus GFM `[ ]`/`[x]` checkboxes that are
  distinct from TODO tasks. Caret-context editing (Enter continues the list,
  re-indents, etc.), and numbered lists that number the block itself the way
  Logseq does — with the `logseq.order-list-type` property kept invisible.
- **Video & audio embeds.** Insert media as assets with an inline player that
  **falls back to a click-to-open chip** when the platform lacks the codec
  (common on Linux/WebKitGTK).
- **Drag-and-drop files.** Drop files from your OS file manager onto a block to
  insert them as assets.
- **Media management.** Instant feedback when pasting an image; an
  **orphaned-media** scanner (Settings → Backups) that finds `assets/` files no
  block references and moves them to a recoverable trash (clickable names, file
  dates, empty-trash button). New assets get human-readable, timestamped names.
- **Custom journal date formats.** Tine now reads `:journal/file-name-format` and
  `:journal/page-title-format`, so graphs that previously *"wouldn't load"* (e.g.
  `dd-MM-yyyy`, `yyyy-MM-dd`, `yyyyMMdd`) open correctly; the display-title format
  is pickable in Settings → *Journals & tasks*.
- **Duplicate-day reconcile.** If two files resolve to the same day (e.g. a
  `2026_06_26.org` plus a title-named `Friday, 26-06-2026.org` left over from a
  date-format change), Tine keeps **both** rather than silently dropping one, and
  Settings → Backups → **Duplicate journal days** lets you reach each file:
  **Open** it (editable, saves back to itself), **Merge** a stray into the
  canonical day, **Rename** it to a normal page, or **Trash** the redundant one.
- **Calculator block.** An OG-style live, in-place calc block.
- **Sticky, closable toasts.** Notifications that need attention stay until you
  dismiss them.

### Changed

- The **agenda** (Scheduled & Deadline in the journal) hides `DONE`/`CANCELED`
  items, matching Logseq.
- `SCHEDULED:`/`DEADLINE:` are now detected **anywhere in a block**, not only on
  the first line — so the badge renders and agenda queries match either way.

### Fixed

- **Rename is transactional and complete.** A page rename + every
  `[[ref]]`/`#tag`/`tags::`/namespace rewrite across the graph commits
  all-or-nothing (re-checking each file just before writing, rolling back on
  conflict), handles self-references, and **leaves refs inside code fences and
  bare URLs alone**. Org `[[file:…][desc]]` link targets are rewritten too.
- Context-menu **"Rename page"** now works (the WebKitGTK prompt was a silent
  no-op).
- **CRLF line endings round-trip** — editing a Windows-authored file no longer
  flips every line and churns Syncthing diffs.
- **Linux AppImage**: a Wayland EGL crash is auto-fixed at launch (no manual
  `LD_PRELOAD` needed).
- Several editor caret/selection fixes (multi-line Shift+Down block selection,
  click-to-caret position, within-block Shift+Right).
- Removed the per-file confirm when trashing media (it's recoverable and
  batch-friendly).

### Reliability & performance

- A data-safety audit pass closed concurrency and round-trip issues across the
  rename, derived-result cache, and org write paths; Tine **never silently
  overwrites a file that changed on disk** — it surfaces a conflict instead.
- Inline parsing rewritten to be linear (was O(n²) on big blocks); the page cache
  and derived results are now `Arc`-shared; query/backlink invalidation is scoped
  to the pages that actually changed; per-block search/reference projections are
  memoized; and the launch backup is staggered off first-paint I/O.

### Notes

- macOS and Windows installers are currently **unsigned** — on macOS right-click →
  Open; on Windows choose *More info → Run anyway*.
